<p>The following letter from Mr. Benton,
from Singapore, will be read with interest.
That city is a great seaport near
the Islands of Borneo and Java. Mr.
Benton’s search after those large bees&mdash;<i>Apis
dorsata</i>&mdash;is a herculean task,
and his trip thither will be well worth
a place in history. Here is the letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p id="Exploring_for_Javan_Bees_in_Ceylon"><span class="smcap">Friend Jones</span>: When in Ceylon I
plunged into the jungles, first in this direction
and then in that, and followed
out every clue that I could obtain; yet
although on every side I was told there
existed “a large bee,” which the natives
call <i>bambera</i>, it was not until just before
I came away that I ascertained anything
reliable regarding the habits and
whereabouts of this wonderful insect,
which I feel safe in saying is the long
talked of <i>Apis dorsata</i> itself; though
it was too late for me to get to the
places where I could see this bee and
still reach this steamer. As I return to
Ceylon, and am likely to see <i>Apis dorsata</i>
elsewhere also, I comforted myself
regarding the disappointment experienced
at not seeing this <i>bambera</i> before
my re-embarkation.</p>

<p>I will speak in the order of their size,
of the bees found in Ceylon, giving the
Cingalese names used there.</p>

<p><i>Kana Mee Meso</i> belongs to the <i>Trigonæ</i>,
and therefore is not a true honey
bee, although it gathers pollen and
some honey, and lives in swarms with a
queen. In a jungle a few miles from
Kaltura, on the southwest coast of Ceylon,
I found a small bee which contained
a nest of these minute, stingless
bees. A tube about ¾ of an inch in diameter
and a foot long, composed of
propolis and particles of wood, hung
from the hole of the tree, and through
this tube all the bees entered. It seems
this is a means of keeping out larger
insects. The tree was cut and the nest
secured. The cells are built in irregular
bunches like those made by common
bumble bees. Those cells containing
brood were about the size of a grain
of rice, while the honey and pollen cells
were as large as the smaller cells made
by bumble bees. The workers are
somewhat less than 3/16 of an inch
long, (about 5/32) have large heads, and
very small abdomens, the latter seeming
blunt, and abbreviated, so to speak.
These bees fly swiftly, and look odd
enough as they come in loaded with minute
pellets of pollen, which is packed
on their hind legs as with other bees.
They are black.</p>

<p>The queen is large, her abdomen being
so great as to dwarf in appearance
all other parts of her body, and so disable
her as far as flying and rapid movements
are concerned. Of course there
can be no practical value in these bees,
but I tucked the nest in a box about 6
inches square and 2 deep, or rather a
part of the brood and honey, and brought
the swarm along. They have been fixing
up their new home quite bravely.</p>

<p><i>Daudual-Meso</i> is a small bee which I
have not seen, but which I do not believe
is likely to prove valuable, since it
is so small. Its comb is composed of
regular hexagonal wax cells, like all
comb of <i>Apis</i>, but there are 81 cells to
the square inch. I have in my possession
a small piece.</p>

<p><i>Mee Meso</i> are the Cingalese words
signifying “honey bee,” and this is the
bee from which, aside from <i>bambera</i>,
most of the honey and wax come.</p>

<p><i>Bambera</i>, all accounts agree, exists
plentifully in the jungles of Ceylon, but
I found just before I came away, only
rarely near the seashore, I failed to find
it within 10 miles of the coast. I was
glad to get accounts from persons who
have seen these bees and their trees,
and have measured the lengths of their
combs; observing gentlemen, too,
whose word can be relied upon. They
say these bees, which I feel sure are of
the species <i>Apis dorsata</i>, attach their
combs to the branches of trees, usually
some lofty trees of the primitive forest,
and a gentleman who has often seen
them, says they build combs 8 feet long.
Another once measured a comb which
he found to be 6 feet long. The first
mentioned gentleman says he has seen
30 natives with earthen pots each receive
a load from one <i>bambera</i> bee tree,
and has seen a swarm of these bees
nearly a half mile long. When I visited
the Government Museum in order
to obtain information as to whether they
knew anything of these bees and where
they were to be found, the natives having
only succeeded in finding <i>deborah</i>,
(a large hornet) with its nest, for me. I
was at once taken by one of the directors
to this gentleman, as the one from
whom the most information could be
obtained.</p>

<p>The Cyprian and Palestine bees I have
with me are doing finely. Those left in
Ceylon will serve to introduce the species
<i>A. melifica</i>, and will establish in
that wonderful productive Island an industry
that I feel sure will thrive there
and be a source of revenue to the inhabitants
and the government.</p>

<p>Upon my return I have formed the
plan of taking with me for introduction
to Cyprus a lot of cocoanut palm trees,
some mango and bread-fruit seeds or
trees, and a species of paw-paw found
in Ceylon. As the date-palm, the orange,
the lemon, the fig, the banana and
the pomegranate are already growing in
Cyprus, I believe these new fruits will
thrive and find favor. Financially, of
course, it is an experiment, yet I believe
it promises well; at any rate it will not
cost much to try it.</p>

<p>Except this paw-paw, I failed to find
any fruit or grain that is likely to thrive
in as cold a climate as the central parts
of North America. Cinnamon, coffee,
tea, betel nuts, precious stones and cocoanuts
and oil are, with cinchona bark,
the principal exports of Ceylon. I
talked with various exporters, but all
had their agents in N. Y. and Canada,
and desired no change. None of them
would sell, of course, direct to the firm,
when possessing an agent in America.</p>

<p>Upon my return I will see what
further can be ascertained as to “out-of-the-way
products.” It is hard to get
any prices, and would in most instances
be difficult to obtain a quantity worth
while to ship.</p>

<p>From Arabia, coffee, gums, perfumes
and pearls come. At Aden I was told
that the best Mocha coffee could be got
for one shilling (or 24 cts.) per lb. In
large quantities I think it can be got
still cheaper. I should think precious
stones (sapphire, jasper, &amp;c.,) gums, coffee,
cocoanut oil, cinnamon oil and pearl
would pay best, perhaps also ivory and
ostrich feathers. At Aden I found
some large wheat, but kinds were mixed,
or else the variety is not a fixed sort.
This portion of the world produces little
or no grain besides rice.</p>

<p>I have obtained seeds of a number of
flowering plants and trees, some of
which I know yield honey, and others
that look as though they might were
there bees to gather it. We expect to
reach Singapore to-morrow forenoon. I
will take the first steamer for Batavia,
which will likely leave in a day or so.</p>

<h2 id="Cause_of_Bee_Cholera_or_Dysentery">Cause of Bee Cholera or Dysentery.<br />

<span class="large">G. M. DOOLITTLE.</span></h2>

<p>I have noticed in several articles a
statement quite similar to this, which
is taken from Mr. James Heddon’s article
in the February number of the <i>Bee-Keepers’
Instructor</i>: “Every bee-keeper
of experience who lives in our northern
latitudes has witnessed enough to know
that cold or confinement, or both, do
not <i>cause</i> bee cholera or dysentery.”
Now, I claim the title “bee-keeper”
(whether of experience or not I dare not
say), and live in the “northern latitudes,”
yet I cannot be one of the number
above styled as “<i>every</i>,” for I believe
confinement <i>does cause</i> the so-called dysentery,
and hope to so clearly show it in
this article that you will so acknowledge
also.</p>

<p>First. I once produced dysentery (I
do not believe this is a disease, but
merely an accumulation of the feces) in
its worst form, the latter part of June,
by confining a lot of bees to the hive
for 10 days. A frame of brood was taken
from the hive with the adhering bees,
and also a frame of honey with the bees
which were on that, and placed in an
empty hive to form a nucleus, the bees
being confined to the hive for three or
four days, when the entrance was opened
in the evening. Early the next morning
there came on a cold storm and bad
weather ensued, so the bees could not
fly for six more days. On the tenth day
the sun came out, and the bees from
these nuclei (7 in number) were so loaded
that they could scarcely fly. An examination
revealed that they had eaten on
an average about 2 lbs. of honey in each
nucleus. Nuclei made but a few days
before, which had flown 2 or 3 times before
the bad weather, were not eager to
fly, and showed no signs of dysentery,
neither did our full colonies; nor had
they eaten an undue amount of honey.
The trouble here was evidently confinement,
which caused the bees to worry
and thereby consume an undue quantity
of food, thus producing a necessity to
void the excrement, or dysentery, if you
please to call it so.</p>

<p>Again, in the fall of 1878 our bees
were prepared for winter in the best
possible shape, and had nothing but
white honey in their hives, said honey
being collected the early part of July,
for we had no fall honey. Sixty colonies
were put in the cellar, and 90 left on the
summer stands, two-thirds of which
were packed with chaff and straw.
Winter set in early, and the weather
was so cold that no bees could fly with
safety for nearly 4½ months. At the
end of 4 months some of our best colonies
were dead, with the combs and
hives soiled badly, while others sitting
right alongside of them were in as fine
condition as could be, and remained
thus, coming out strong in the spring.
If it was “bacteria” in the honey, why
did not all die, as all had the same
stores? We also placed 60 colonies from
the same yard in the cellar on the 1st of
November, and did not set them out till
May 1st, and 55 of the 60 came out in
good condition, while we only saved 15
out of the 90 out-doors&mdash;75 dying with
the dysentery, so-called. If it was infection
of the honey, why did not those
in the cellar die also, and especially as
they stood 6 month’s confinement? The
past winter has shown the same results,
only our loss is but about 10 per cent.
so far.</p>

<p>Now I will give my conclusion. From
practical experience I have been forced
to the conclusion that confinement is
the cause of all wintering troubles, for
surely, bees do not die from what they
eat in July weather when they can fly.
But confine them to the hive with July
weather, and they cannot live one-third
as long as in cool or cold weather. That
confinement is the result whenever the
mercury falls below 40° to 45° in the
shade, and as surely as the mercury stays
below this for 60 days in succession,
bees not properly protected will suffer
therefrom, and if properly protected,
120 days will more or less hurt those on
the summer stands; that 180 days’ confinement
in a good cellar can be endured
by the bees as well as 120 days in well-protected
hives, or 60 days with no protection
on the summer stands; that if
60 days more of confinement is added in
either case, not 1 colony in 10 can survive,
no matter what the food is nor the
surrounding conditions. Now, we come
to our last point, which is, that instead
of the trouble being in the kind of honey
eaten thus producing dysentery, the
trouble is in the quantity eaten, and as
the quantity consumed is to the number
of days the bees are confined, so is their
length of life shortened or extended.
For instance, a fair-sized colony may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
consume 1½ lbs. of honey per month,
and endure confinement without soiling
the combs for 6 months; now, if they
consume 6 times this amount in 2
months, they must fly at the end of that
time or the combs will be soiled very
soon thereafter. We often read, “My
bees wintered well and consumed but
very little honey,” while the fact was
that their consuming but little honey
was the reason they wintered well.
Thus we are able to answer the question
why one colony dies, and another at the
side of it does not. It is because one
gets discontented and consumes large
quantities of honey, while the other
does not.</p>

<p>Now comes the rub: why does one
colony get discontented within 1 month
after being confined, and another does
not under 3 or 4, or in case of cellar wintering,
6 months. Well, I will be candid
and say I do not know; but I do not
believe the cause is in the honey altogether.
One thing Mr. Heddon and
myself will agree on I am sure, and that
is, if as soon and as often as a colony
gets uneasy and goes to eating honey
ravenously they could have a day to fly,
all would be well, even if such a colony
was obliged to fly 3 or 4 times where another
did not have to but once.</p>

<p>To keep bees quiet the longest possible
time I would recommend: 1st. A
good bee cellar in a bank, covered all
over with no less than 3 feet of earth,
and an even temperature maintained
inside at 44° to 45°; 2d. Hives so constructed
that chaff could entirely surround
the bees to the depth of 4 inches.
To sum up, we should winter one-half
of our apiary one way and one-half the
other, inasmuch as our winters vary so
that one winter has come out the best
on summer stands, and another the best
from the cellar. I will refer to this
subject again in the next Weekly <span class="smcap">Bee
Journal</span>.</p>

<h2 id="Extracting_Bees_The_New_Industry">Extracting Bees.&mdash;The New Industry.<br />

<span class="large">H. T. COLLINS.</span></h2>

<p>As the exigencies of the times have
created the new industry of “extracting
dead bees” from the cells, and as
many of the bee-keeping fraternity may
want to do so without delay in order to
save time, I give my plan, as I think
the one suggested by our editor, though
good in the main, is apt to break the
combs too much. The necessary tools
are a small pair of tweezers (such as
taxidermists use), a light and sharp
darning needle, and last but not least, a
shallow tin pan, say one inch deep and
13¾ × 17¾ inches. Every keeper of 10 or
more colonies should have one or more
pans&mdash;they just fill the bottom of a 10-frame
Langstroth hive, and are as
handy as a pocket in a shirt. Instead
of the pan, a common table waiter will
answer. Sitting in a good light, place
the pan lengthwise across the lap, and
lay the frame across the pan, but parallel
with the lap. The use of the pan is
to give a convenient rest to the frame,
and to hold the dead bees. If you are
right-handed, let the top of the frame
be towards the right hand, if not, <i>vice
versa</i>. Holding the tweezers in the
hand, which is right (often the left one),
grasp the bee and pull it out slowly and
gently, and with the motion of the
hand towards the top of the frame. As
in the natural position, the base of the
cell is horizontally the lowest, the above
mentioned motion extracts the bee with
the least friction. But in some combs
they will stick so tight as to break off
at the junction of the abdomen, and to
prevent this, with the darning needle
pierce the thorax as it comes to the
edge of the cell, and by its help you can
nearly every time drag out the too-tightly
lodged bee. A cup of warm
water will be convenient in removing
the sticky deposit that will often adhere
to the end of the tweezers. To the inexperienced,
the above may seem to be
a slow and tedious way of extracting
bees, but a little practice will make one
skillful, and if any one has a better way
please communicate it promptly, as
this new industry promises, from the
weekly reports, to be a large and growing
one.</p>

<p>For the benefit of some who do not
as yet understand all my argument
against the use of separators I wish to
add, that I am well aware that the system
of sections within frames hung in
a super, is entirely impracticable without
the use of separators. I know too
that, as Messrs. Greiner Bros. remark,
bees take more kindly to wood than to
tin or glass, and there is just where the
trouble comes, as they sometimes kindly
attach the sides of the combs to them.
Some seasons, under peculiar circumstances,
the loss of honey by the use of
separators might, as Greiner Bros. say,
be very slight, but in many seasons they
will be found to be a serious detriment
to the amount of surplus obtained. But
why not use a system that does not need
them, and is much handier than the super
system besides?</p>

<p>I supposed that the younger bee-keepers,
who keep posted, knew that many
old producers on a more extensive scale
never used separators at all, and of that
class who did many others are laying
them aside. Bees do finish up their
combs full better with separators, because
as the season draws to a close they
are less inclined to start another comb
in one of those little compartments, and
as long as there is honey coming in they
finish with it to keep from <i>perfect</i> idleness.
I think the unfinished combs
are just so much extra. If it is “strange”
that I should declare against the use of
<i>all</i> separators, while still many prominent
bee-keepers use them, how dare
you, Messrs. G., declare against tin,
compared with wood, when you know
that tin is the popular material? Galileo
said, “The world is round;” all others
said, “It is flat,” and there being
more of the “flats” than Galileos, these
“flats” put their greatest scientist behind
the prison bars.</p>

<p>Before I close, I wish to call the attention
of the readers of this paper to the
able article of A. B. Weed, on “Queen
and Supply Trade,” in the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>
of March 23d. I think all bee-keepers,
whether supply-dealers or producers
strictly, if posted upon the
points therein taken, will say, “Thanks
to Mr. Weed.”</p>

<h2 id="Pure_Liquid_Honey_in_Glass_Jars">Pure Liquid Honey in Glass Jars.<br />

<span class="large">CHAS. F. MUTH.</span></h2>

<p>The above subject is one which has
provoked considerable comment, and it
appears we are not quite done with it
yet. I dare say that there is not a dealer
of any note in Cincinnati, by this time,
who imagines that my jar honey is anything
but pure honey, or who suspects
any honey when it comes from my store;
and I am just as positive in the statement
that there is not a dealer in Cincinnati,
having extracted honey from
New York or Chicago in store, who does
not believe it to be glucosed. There is
hardly anybody in our community who
suspects the purity of the honey when
my label is on the jar. Jar-honey, in
general, is not mistrusted any more in
our city, unless the jar contains besides
the liquid, also a piece of comb honey.
Such is the case in Cincinnati, to all appearances,
and I am willing to be corrected
if wrong.</p>

<p>The subjoined letter from a party in
New York, and my answer to them,
show an interesting difference in the
state of the market for extracted honey
in our city and New York, the home of
Mr. W. M. Hoge, Wm. Hogue or John
Long. To avoid misunderstanding, I
may state that Hoge, Hogue or Long,
while in New York, was bottling honey
for the firm of Thurber &amp; Co. In explanation
of the letters following, I may
state that the editor of the <i>Cincinnati
Grocer</i> had been recommending my
honey to Messrs. Guernsey &amp; Co., N. Y.,
who opened correspondence with me,
and to me he had recommended them as
perhaps the best party to introduce my
honey in the New York market. The
result was that I sent them 1 gross of
1 lb. jars and 1 gross of ½ lb. tumblers,
at cost, on 60 days’ time. The honey
commenced granulating in the course of
a month or more. This fact, and the
general mistrust to extracted honey in
New York must be taken into consideration
to do the following correspondence
justice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
New York, March 17, 1881.<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">C. F. Muth</span>&mdash;<i>Dear Sir</i>: Enclosed
please find bill of lading for the honey
sent us. We find it totally impossible
to sell the goods, as parties here are
afraid of glucose, etc. We waited for
parties to decide about them, and they
concluded not to take them. We are
sorry, but such is the case. We have
retained one box of each, bottles and
tumblers, to pay us for the freight paid
on goods here. Yours very respectfully,</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Guernsey &amp; Co.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>To which I replied as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Messrs. <span class="smcap">Guernsey &amp; Co.</span>&mdash;<i>Gents</i>:
Your favor is at hand. I expect the
return of my honey with all the charges
deducted you feel disposed to make. I
had supposed that there were some men
in your city with enough sense to determine
the difference between honey and
glucose. My honey is <i>strictly pure</i>, and
will pay you $100 if you will prove that
I am wrong. Yours truly,</p>

<p class="author">

<p>Cincinnati, Ohio, March 21, 1881.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>[We were shown quite recently a letter
received by a prominent dealer in
strictly pure honey in this city, from a
correspondent in Virginia, who had ordered
and received from him a keg of
honey. They say: “The keg of honey
came to hand on the 25th; you may
imagine my chagrin on opening the
package and finding the contents <i>solid</i>.
In its present condition it is of no value
to me.” Although a dealer, we suppose
this was really the first package of
<i>strictly pure</i> extracted honey he had ever
seen, or he would have felt pleasure, instead
of chagrin, to find it granulated
solid. The truth is, the public have
been so much deceived with a spurious
article in liquid form, that many do not
know the genuine when they see it. A
bee-keeper or person perfectly familiar
with honey in a northern or central latitude,
would require something more
convincing than the mere assertion of a
respectable grocer that his honey was
strictly pure, if not candied or granulated
in cool weather.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<span class="large">BRAY &amp; SEACORD.</span></h2>

<p>An experience of 20 years with bees
has taught me to wait upon them and
not to have them wait upon me; in
other words, always have your work
ahead of time. Next, to have your bees
in strong condition at the time of the
first flow of honey. The great mistake
of beginners is to aim at too large an
increase, either by division or natural
swarming. If the season is good, an
increase of 3 from each colony is a
plenty; if a medium season an increase
of one from each colony is enough.</p>

<p>The brood chamber is the mainspring
to work upon for a good yield of honey.
We allow no queen to live over 3 years,
and if not a prolific queen she only
lives one year. We allow no brood
comb to remain over 3 years in the centre
of the hive; by this plan we get fine
developed bees, and of longer life.</p>

<p>Our plan of separating swarms of 2
or more, when they come out and cluster
together, may be of benefit to some.
It is as follows: Make a box 3 feet long
(or any size that will fit the frames of
your hive), make one entrance to the
box for the bees to pass in and out;
make a tight cover to fit the box, with
cleats on 2 sides, no end cleats; make 3
or 4 division boards; then the box is
ready for hiving the bees.</p>

<p>Now take the box and hive the cluster
of 2 or more swarms, and as soon as all
the bees are in the box, put it in a shady
place, and let it remain there until the
next morning; then push the box
cover lengthwise of the box and you
will observe each queen with her colony
clustered by themselves; now place
the division board between each cluster,
push the cover back again over the
cluster and hive at pleasure.</p>

<p>The present season is fully 6 weeks
ahead of last season; drones were in
the air on the 28th of Feb. We keep our
colonies in a condition so that the queen
can breed up to her full capacity. The
Italian queens we received from the
<span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span> apiary last fall, wintered
well, and we now have several nuclei
started for queen-rearing, as we mean
to Italianize all of our bees by the end
of the present season. The prospects
were never better than now for a booming
good year.</p>

<p>At some future time we will give our
experience in wintering bees in a cold
climate on 4 lbs. 2 ounces of honey per
colony, before chaff packing was invented.</p>

<p>If a Syrian queen cross with the black
drone, would not this cross produce the
Italian bee? Success to the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>.</p>

<p>Warthan, Cal. March 15, 1881.</p>

<p>[If the Italian bee is a hybrid, and
originally produced by mating the black
drone with the Syrian queen, then, of
course, a like cause will again produce
a like effect; but if the Italian bee is a
distinct race, then no crossing of other
races will produce it as a fixed type.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.]</p>

<span class="large">D. D. PALMER.</span></h2>

<p>The raspberry can be grown in any
land that will produce a crop of corn or
potatoes. It furnishes a fine quality of
honey, and a delicious fruit, coming
immediately after strawberries. Sandy
or light soils produce a better flavored
fruit but not so much nor as large as
clay soils.</p>

<p>The ground should be spaded or
ploughed deep, and raked or harrowed
thoroughly so as to pulverize it. If you
get plants by mail, dip them in water
as soon as received and bury the roots
in moist shady ground until you are
ready to set them out. Plants can be
sent by mail with as much certainty of
arriving in good condition as if carried
personally or sent by express. Handle
so as to expose the roots to the sun and
wind as little as possible. For garden
or field culture plant 2½ or 3 feet
apart in the row and the rows 6 feet
apart. A convenient implement to use
in setting any small plants is called a
dibble, made similar to a mason’s
trowel, and cost me 25 cts. each. Make
the holes deep enough to take in the
long roots without doubling them up.
Spread the roots out like a fan, fill with
mellow soil and pack snugly among
the roots, if the ground is dry pour in
water before filling up, then fill up with
dry or moist soil, leaving the surface
loose and mellow. If dry weather prevails,
remove the top soil and pour in
plenty of water; after the water has
settled replace the soil. They may be
cultivated the same as corn, being
careful not to cultivate too deep as some
of the roots grow near the surface.
Cabbage or other root plants may be
planted and cultivated among them the
first season. Fruit trees may be planted
with them in the row.</p>

<p>There are several ways of training
the bushes; some use stakes. This we
consider an expensive practice, unless
it be for garden planting, when very
close planting is required and it is not
wished to have a spreading bush. Our
method consists in training them while
they are growing. When 18 inches high
pinch off with the fingers, or where a
field is to be pruned we have found a
pair of large scissors, with blades 5
inches long, to be an excellent thing to
prune with; with them we can prune a
row as fast as we can walk. You will
need to prune the patch 2 or 3 times
each season. In the spring, when the
plants are one year old, prune or cut off
all the laterals within 12 or 18 inches of
the main stock before they start to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
grow; the second season out the
dead wood and train the laterals so as to
make the rows like a hedge; nip or cut
off the new shoots when 3 feet high. In
this way they bear larger and better
fruit, are more convenient to pick, and
are not blown down by the wind, as the
bushes support each other.</p>

<p>The red varieties are increased by
suckers or sprouts from the roots. They
may be cultivated 2 seasons, and if
needed for honey more than choice
fruit, they may be allowed to occupy
the ground. The black caps are increased
from tips, i.e. by the ends of
the vines taking root. The Doolittle,
Mammoth Cluster and Home Sweet
Home are especially adapted to cultivate
in hedge rows, on account of their
stock canes.</p>

<p>Farmers might load their tables with
this delicious, health giving fruit the
year round, by setting 25 plants of Doolittle
for early, and 100 of Sweet Home
for late use and canning.</p>

<span class="large">E. A. THOMAS.</span></h2>

<p>There has been much discussion of
late about “How to obtain the best race
of bees,” and I notice there is a great
diversity of opinion in regard to it. I
fully agree with the editor of the <span class="smcap">American
Bee Journal</span> that the coming
bee will be the <i>Apis Americana</i>, a cross
between our present Italians and some
other race, and I believe that, although
there are but few who hold that opinion
now, the time is not far distant when
the majority of the apiarists of America
will acknowledge the superiority of
the American strain of Italians.</p>

<p>During the past few years there has
been a mania among bee-keepers for
imported stock which has steadily increased
up to the present time, but which
I sincerely hope has now reached its
height. Do not understand by this that
I object to all importations for I do not,
but only to those careless and almost
reckless ones that, instead of improving,
will cause the deterioration of our
present excellent strain. So long as
queen breeders in Italy know that any
queens they may see fit to send to America
will be accepted just because they
came from Italy, just so long will some
of them take advantage of such knowledge
to ship to this country queens
they would not be willing to use themselves,
and which American bee-keepers
would not accept as a gift if they knew
what stock they sprang from. But only
let them understand that they must
send only the very best and purest that
Italy can afford, or lose the American
trade, and they will be more careful
how they try to impose upon the credulity
of American bee-keepers. There
are many good reliable breeders in Italy,
and those who are desirous of importing
should search them out and give
such their orders, and give all others a
severe “letting alone.” But to return
to my subject. When an apiarist becomes,
satisfied that he has an excellent
strain of bees he should be very careful
how he introduces new blood into his
apiary, I care not from what source it
comes whether from Italy or a home
breeder, until he has thoroughly tested
it and found it to be good. Many a bee-keeper
after having obtained a class of
bees that did credit to America and
which bid fair to become worthy of the
name <i>Apis Americana</i>, not content to
let “well enough alone,” has ruined his
stock by introducing foreign blood that
was as worthless as it was cheap. For
the improvement of our present strain
of bees I would suggest that queen
breeders exchange queens from their
working stock and make a careful
record of the result of the cross. When
they get a cross that is an improvement
on their own bees let them breed from
it and introduce the blood into their
apiary. Thus by crossing the best blood
in the country we may hope to obtain a
strain of Italians that will rival those
found in Italy, and which will be exported
to all parts of Europe.</p>

<p>As regards the color of our bees, I
beg to differ with those who consider it
necessary to breed dark colored bees in
order to obtain good honey gatherers. I
have bred both dark and light colored,
and I am satisfied that my present
strain, which is as handsome as any one
need wish for, has excelled anything I
ever had or saw. If breeders will work
carefully and use every means in their
power to improve their bees, we may
live to see Mr. Newman’s prophecy
come true, and the <i>Apis Americana</i>
have a world-wide fame.</p>

<span class="large">DR. DZIERZON.</span></h2>

<p>In looking over a nucleus the past season,
I found a young Italian queen just
hatched. She was very large and beautiful,
but in trying to make her flight
she fell to the ground, because of her
left wing being considerably shorter,
and she could not rise, although she
made every effort. If I had possessed
a surplus queen, or even a queen-cell, I
should have disposed of her; but as I
had not, I left her in the hive, hoping
that she might gain strength enough to
enable her to make her wedding trip.
Two days after I looked again and found
my queen there still, and my experiments
with her proved that she was as
unable to fly as before. It occurred to
me to shorten her long wing to produce
equilibrium. She could then fly some,
but dropped to the ground again. After
I had trimmed her long wing down
to the size of the crippled one, she succeeded
in keeping herself up in the air
for quite a while, although it seemed
very hard work for her, and she finally
reached her hive. I let her run in, then
fixed an alighting-board, that she might
have a chance to run from the ground
up to her hive, if compelled.</p>

<p>On one of the following days I was in
the apiary again at noon, and on looking
about I noticed great excitement in
one of the neighboring hives near said
nucleus. When I opened the hive I
found the short-winged queen in there
balled, but not yet injured. Undoubtedly
she came out to meet a drone, and
on returning entered the wrong hive,
which, when we consider her clumsiness,
could not be wondered at. I picked her
out of the ball, and took her back to her
own hive. A few days after I found
her depositing eggs, and she proved to
be fertile; but whether she was fertilized
on that trip, or whether she made
another, is not certain.</p>

<p>In writing upon this subject I fully
realize the difficulties of the task before
me, and also the differences of opinion
that exist on this interesting subject,
and one that is of such vast importance
to the honey producer of to-day. We
are yet in the infancy of this enterprise,
and time will doubtless reveal many
changes and improvements where now
we think we have attained perfection.
Of course practical bee-keepers will employ
all their energies to keep up with
the times, and give their patrons the
benefit of new developments as soon as
they are proved to be improvements.
We should ascertain what the market
demands and then diligently apply ourselves
to the work, in order to reap the
reward.</p>

<p>We talk of supply and demand; of
overstocking the markets and overstocking
the land. But in solving the
problem of “marketing,” man’s inventive
genius is called upon to provide
the necessary elements, whereby the
desired results may be attained without
increased expense to the consumer or
decreased profit to the producer. This
is a practical age and requires practical
inventions, to be used in the race for
the “mighty dollar.”</p>

<p>There need be no fear of overstocking
the markets. Honey is being used by
many manufacturers in the liquid form,
and its demand is increasing throughout
the land. Honey in the comb is
finding its way to the tables of thousands
of families throughout all Europe,
where till recently it was never seen.
Thus the question of overstocking the
market is nearly settled. All honor to
the Messrs. Thurber and their representative
in Europe for their untiring
energies in this grand undertaking.
There are but few of us that realize the
benefits of the exertions put forth by
this great firm in finding a market for
our products. Their undertaking has
been crowned with success, and to them
we owe our sincere thanks if nothing
more. The markets of the world are
open to our products, and it is now our
duty to see that those markets are not
ruined through any fault or neglect on
the part of the American producer. We
must also have united action looking
toward the prevention of adulterations.</p>

<p>We must have co-operation in marketing
honey, to produce the most satisfactory
results. We have seen what
wonderful results have been accomplished
by associate action, and by a
combination of interests. The great
enterprises of to-day, that are so astonishing
in their magnitude, are the results
of associated effort, and this is
destined to revolutionize the business
operations of the world. We have seen
what wonderful results have been accomplished
by the associated system of
dairymen. What unity and action has
done for dairying and other branches of
industry it may also accomplish for apiculture.
Association and unity of action
are the great mainsprings of power
and progress in the world. I am pleased
to know that the bee-keepers of this
country are awakening to this principle
in marketing their products.</p>

<p>While in New York city last October
I devoted one whole day investigating
the honey market, and I must say that
I was completely disgusted with the
workings thereof. Not being personally
acquainted with more than two of the
firms handling honey, I had a splendid
opportunity to investigate the facilities
and the workings of many houses,
by withholding my name and pleading
ignorance. The honey of some of our
leading apiarists was found in several
different commission houses, and one
apiarist in particular, who has probably
written and said more upon this subject
of “marketing honey” than any other
one person, consigned his honey to more
than one commission house, and the
honey was not put up in a very marketable
condition at that; the edges of the
boxes being covered with propolis, and
evidently no attempt had been made to
remove it. One commission house sold
this man’s white honey for 12 cents,
while another house was holding this
same man’s honey at 18 cents.</p>

<p>One of the four honey houses in New
York informed me that they received
two-thirds of all the honey sent to that
market. The proprietor of another
house told me that he handled most of
the honey sent on commission to that
city. Of course I saw their stock of
honey, and truthfully say that both
houses combined do not sell one-fourth
the amount of honey sold by either of
the other two houses. These men misrepresented
their business, and if they
misrepresented to me why wouldn’t
they do the same to all other producers.</p>

<p>Then there are other commission
men who receive now and then a small
consignment of honey, and in almost
every instance you will find that honey
setting outside the door begging for a
sale. After seeing all this and much
more, I can say without fear of successful
contradiction, that at present there
are but two firms in New York that
have the facilities of handling our products,
H. K. &amp; F. B. Thurber &amp; Co.,
and D. W. Quinby. Undoubtedly there
is not another firm in this country that
can place our honey on the markets of
Europe to so good an advantage as can
the Messrs. Thurber, while Mr. Quinby,
who has been in the business for many
years and has many customers, can
place honey to good advantage and satisfactory
to the consignor. Both these
firms are making a specialty of our products,
and they are the only ones. Go
to New York with your honey; see
where it is destined; look over the field
before you, and I will venture to say
you will corroborate all I have said.</p>

<p>Such being the case, what are we to
do? We must have unity of action.
Let us concentrate what honey we put
on that market by sending to these two
houses. By so doing our honey will
command a higher price, sell faster, and
thereby insure us quicker and more
satisfactory returns. What will apply
to the New York market will hold good
for any of our markets. We must concentrate
our honey, and the quicker we
do this the sooner we shall be able to
sell our products for cash.</p>

<p>I will venture here to present another
subject of great importance, and one
that needs the co-operative effort of
every apiarist. “Statistics of the aggregate
production of both comb and
extracted honey.” With united action
this can be accomplished. I would suggest
that this association petition our
national society, praying that the president
thereof shall appoint reliable and
willing vice-presidents in each and
every State in the Union, whose duty
it shall be to demand of each and every
secretary of the different associations
within his State to collect the correct
statistics of the yield within his territory;
to report to the vice-president,
who in turn shall report to the secretary
of the National society, and he be required
to cause the same to be published
in each of the bee-journals no
later than the first of September.</p>

<p>Every bee-keeper in making up his
report should be very careful not to
over-estimate his yield. In the past
this has worked injury to our markets,
many bee-keepers making a fictitious
and an exaggerated report for fear that
some neighboring apiarist may lead
them in the amount of honey produced.
This is all wrong and I trust we shall
soon see the end. Remember that
honey buyers keep their eyes upon all
reports regarding the amount of honey
produced in the country. That from
these reports they fix the price to be
paid; and when we go to sell our honey
we are compelled to face the reports.
When we are able to furnish correct
statistics, then we shall see the benefit.</p>

<p>Our larger markets are mostly supplied
by the larger producers or specialists,
while our local or smaller markets
are left to the amateur or novice. To
control these lesser lights will be hard
work; but as long as they keep out of
the larger markets they will do no great
injury. They will be helping to increase
the consumption. As soon as
we get to a basis of buying and selling,
speculators will control these small lots.</p>

<p>Our markets are also much injured
by placing our products upon them in
an unmarketable shape. Honey in the
comb should be placed upon the market
so as to call the attention, and tempt
the consumer to purchase. To this end
we should put up our comb honey in
single comb sections, the combs being
straight and evenly built and completely
capped over. In regard to size of boxes,
the demand seems to be settling down
to about three sizes, viz: 4x4, 5x5 and
5x6 inches. In glazing, we should have
the glass nicely cleaned and put on in
good shape, being careful to first remove
all propolis or wax adhering
thereto. In grading and crating the
apiarist should give his personal attention,
that he may be positive as to details
should any question arise involving
this part of the work. In grading it is
well to make two grades white and two
grades dark honey, putting all straight
and perfect combs in the first grade,
while those that are stained, unevenly
built combs and not quite capped over
should be put in grade No. 2. In dark
honey we frequently have combs that are
from ¾ up white, being finished with
dark honey. This should be graded
black, No. 1, and all remaining combs
should be classed as buckwheat. In
crating, use only neat white crates
holding 12 boxes, or if the boxes are
small use crates weighing from 20 to 25
lbs. net. The honey must not be veneered
and the crates should weigh
even pounds, i. e., no halves or quarter
pounds. We cannot be too particular
in having our boxes and crates neatly
made and placed on the market free
from all dirt or stain or leakage.</p>

<p>In shipping, great care must be exercised.
The crates should be placed in
the car with the combs running with
the car, not over 6 crates high, setting
close together at the side and end.</p>

<p>Extracted honey is now classed as a
staple article, therefore it is best to ship
in bulk or barrels. But if designed for
the retail trade it should be put up in
small packages, such as small tin pails,
or pint or quart glass fruit jars, something
that can be used after the honey
is consumed.

<p>“Sweet are the uses of adversity,” is
a trite remark credited to Shakespeare,
we believe. The winter of 1880-1 will
long be known as one of the most severe
in its nature and direful in its effects,
not only in America but throughout the
world.</p>

<p>A gentleman from Minnesota assures
us that in the southern part of that
State fully 10 feet of snow has fallen
since the great storm of Oct. 14. Losses
and privations have been <i>the rule</i> during
the past 5 or 6 months. Fuel has been
so scarce that in some places even the
“liberty pole” has been sacrificed for
use as fuel; those sections cut off from
communication have been deprived of
tea, coffee and sugar, and the coffee-mill
has been made to serve the purpose
of the flour-mill, to grind wheat for
family use.</p>

<p>Heavy sleet storms have destroyed
the timber, the principal sufferers being
peach, soft maple, hickory and elm
trees.</p>

<p>Birds, sheep, cattle and hogs have
perished by thousands, being deprived
of food and shelter and cut off from succor
by the waves of death from the
north and west, and the oft-repeated
blizzard. Even mankind is no exception&mdash;untold
numbers have been sacrificed
upon the altar of the storm-king.
Snow, hail, wind, blinding storm and
blizzard-blast have united with poisoned
air and miasmatic vapor to sweep men,
women and children into the tomb, and
is it any wonder that our pets&mdash;the
bees&mdash;should suffer in common with all
other forms of life?</p>

<p>But how difficult it is to discover the
“sweet uses” of all this adversity!
True, it may point out the more hardy
kinds of trees, insects, birds and stock,
to withstand the rigors of such seasons&mdash;upon
the principle of “the survival of
the fittest”&mdash;and it may teach men a
valuable lesson on the necessity of securing
more perfect ventilation, drainage
and pure water.</p>

<p>When the unprecedented season
shall have passed, let us try to fathom
these deep lessons in respect to our
bees. Perhaps there is a lesson to be
learned here which we could learn in no
other way. Close observation and profound
study will no doubt be amply rewarded.
“Let patience have her perfect
work.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>☞ Dr. Ehrick Parmly, the genial Recording
Secretary of the North American
Bee-Keepers’ Society, made us a
very pleasant call last Thursday afternoon,
on his return from a three weeks’
tour through Colorado. We are glad to
say the Doctor was looking and feeling
remarkably well after his extended trip,
and his jovial good nature done much
to banish the gloom occasioned by the
drizzling and monotonous snow which
was then falling.</p>

<h3 id="Is_Bee-Keeping_a_Failure">Is Bee-Keeping a Failure?</h3>

<p>Now that the winter is drawing to a
close, and the chilling blasts are becoming
more fitful and spasmodic under the
tardy but certain approach of spring,
we begin to contemplate with an inward
feeling of gratification the genial sunshine
and gentle showers with which
Nature will awaken to life; the far-stretching
fields clothed in emerald
green, the lawns and lanes with their
grassy carpets, the air laden with the
sweet perfume of the blossoms in garden
and orchard, the trees in forest and
grove animated with the feathered songsters
whose little lives seem an incarnation
of happy melody&mdash;all these will
combine to help us forget the dreary
hours of the past, and with keener zest
enjoy the future. But how many will
miss the cheerful hum of the myriads
of toiling bees, whose flitting wings
were wont to bear them from flower to
flower, where they gathered nectar fit
for a banquet of the gods.</p>

<p>We can scarcely wonder that many
have become discouraged and almost
doubt whether bee-keeping pays, when
they think of the meager honey yields
of two successive summers, and view
the untenanted hives and soiled combs
which are left as the sequel to their
cherished hopes for the future. However,
none should be too hasty in passing
judgment. With the hives and
combs already provided, more than one-half
the original investment is saved,
and with a propitious season for the
present, our losses will be made good
with a credit in our favor on the balance
sheet. We cannot expect bee-keeping
to be profitable every season, any more
than any other special branch of industry
which is dependent upon natural
causes, but we can with forethought,
industry and systematic perseverance,
make it as reliable as any other, and
now that many will be compelled to begin
anew (or comparatively so), we suggest
that they begin aright. It will not
be a guaranty of success that they use
the best hive, nor that they have an
abundance of bees; a familiarity with
all the recognized authorities and a mind
crammed with theories, will often fail;
the industrious brown bee will seek in
vain, the gold-banded Italian bee will
tire in its flight, and even <i>Apis dorsata</i>
will view its stores with dismay, if there
be no nectar-laden bloom from which to
gather.</p>

<p>Now is the time to invest for the future.
Every dollar judiciously paid out
for seeds of honey plants will bear compound
interest&mdash;will be “bread cast
upon the waters.” The traditional
two or three weeks of honey-flow can,
with a trifling expenditure, be made to
last more than as many months; a succession
of bloom can be secured, so that
should northerly winds or wet weather
prevail for a time, it would not carry
dismay to our hopes and starvation to
our bees. If, as we hope and confidently
believe, the present should prove an unparalleled
honey season, it will ameliorate
the only tenable objection to melilot
or sweet clover, which is that it blooms
but little or none the first season; and
we can well wait till another season for
our “sweet” reward from it. There
are many other plants which we believe
would repay cultivation in honey alone,
but not one that will bear comparison
with this Esau of the vegetable kingdom.
Never was a better time to start
in right than now, and never can we
truthfully say bee-keeping is more hazardous
than other industries, or less remunerative,
until we have made some
provision against natural failures and
seasonable disasters. Every bee-keeper
should, in justice to himself, test this
matter of planting on a sufficiently extensive
scale to satisfy himself. We
feel confident of the verdict.</p>

<h3 id="Vennors_Predictions_for_April">Vennor’s Predictions for April.</h3>

<p>So remarkable have his predictions
been fulfilled in the past that we hope
we shall not be disappointed in his predictions
for May weather during at
least a part of this month. The following
are his probabilities for April:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There will be sharp frost in the beginning
of April, with a snowfall on the
4th or 5th, but the spring will open
favorably, and everything will be pretty
well advanced by April 15. Floods may
be expected in Chicago about the first
week in April, with high winds also
prevailing in the early part of the
month. Snow-falls are probable about
April 5. Navigation is likely to open
on Lake Ontario about April 7.</p>

<p>The St. Lawrence will be open about
the 9th or 11th, and the first steamship
will probably arrive about the 17th or
18th. The weather will be very stormy
in the Lower Provinces about the 20th,
with very high water prevailing, but
in the West, April will be a dry month.
There will be warm weather just following
the 20th, ending in thunderstorms
on the 24th and 25th. Snowstorms
are probable in the far West on
the 25th and 26th, and snow-falls are
not unlikely to occur in England at the
close of the month. The month will
end wet and cold, but, on the whole,
will be like a May month.</p></blockquote>

<p id="Two_Queens_in_a_Hive"><b>Two Queens in a Hive.</b>&mdash;Mr. Fradenburg
says: “I think I can throw a new
ray of light on this subject, which is
now-a-days attracting some attention
among bee-keepers. I have come to
the conclusion that there are but just
two causes or conditions in which two
laying queens will be found in a hive at
once&mdash;the first is the superseding of an
old and failing queen, in which case
each queen seems to have a sort of reverence
for the other; the second condition
is that the bees in one part of the
hive do not know at all times what is
going on in another part of the hive.
This assertion may raise a storm of opposition
among the fraternity, but I believe
I have the positive evidence to
support it.”</p>

<p id="Correction"><b>Correction.</b>&mdash;In the <span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span>
for March 16, page 85, the number of
my colonies is given as 25; it should be
85. So far as I can learn they are in
good condition. I winter them in the
cellar. I have been handling bees for
6 years. Osage is a growing city, and
will consume all the honey produced in
this locality. There are about 500 colonies
of bees in Mitchell County, and I
will do my share in supplying the market
with honey.</p>

<p id="Using_Old_Combs"><b>Using Old Combs.</b>&mdash;Is it not dangerous
to use combs with dead brood in from
defunct colonies? Is there not danger
of getting foul brood started? I have
a good many of them, and I am undecided
whether to melt them up or save
them. The losses here have been fearful.
I do not think there are 10 live
colonies in Dixon outside of my apiary,
and I have lost ⅓. Those lost were
packed in dry chaff, as Prof. Cook’s
Manual directs, in Langstroth and Simplicity
hives, while Root’s chaff hive
has come out ahead, only 2 or 3 hives of
this kind have failed, out of about 30
chaff hives in use. There were as many
as 10 or 12 different apiaries in and near
Dixon, and I can count 8 of them now
that are all dead; the most of them were
small, containing from 6 to 30 colonies
each. And the end is not yet. Those
yet alive may die soon unless spring
opens at once.</p>

<p>[It is hardly possible there is a great
deal of dead brood in the combs to be removed.
We should not hesitate, if the
brood is dry and shrunken, to place the
combs in strong colonies; but if the
brood is putrid and ropy, and sticks to
the cells, we would not wish to use them,
as it is easy to imagine the possibility
of foul brood or other diseases arising
therefrom. If, as we suspect, your
combs are filled with starved bees, you
can easily remove them by adopting the
plan recommended in the Weekly <span class="smcap">Bee

season last year, except 5 weeks during
the first crop of red clover, which ended
about the 1st of July; and after that
but little honey was gathered. The
bulk of the loss was from neglect or
starvation. As I had a fair demand for
queens and I was breeding for improvement
I kept up the queen breeding until
the last of Oct., and my bees were
in poor condition for an ordinary winter;
much more for such a one as we
have just passed through. I have lost
6 colonies at home, that starved; I have
96 left in fair condition. I wintered in
a cellar expressly arranged for the purpose;
it is perfectly dark, and the temperature

<p id="Ventilation"><b>Ventilation.</b>&mdash;I have met 14 different
persons in the last few days that had,
last Nov., 168 colonies of bees altogether;
now they have in the aggregate 57 living;
these were mostly in frame hives,
on the summer stands, and left to care
for themselves. Nearly all died with
plenty of honey to have carried them
through. This, I think, will be about
the average loss in the counties of
Champaign, Piatt and Moultrie, in this
State. Wm. H. Beckwith started in
the winter with 18 colonies in Langstroth
and box hives, with plenty of
bees and honey in each hive. The hives
were very poorly made, being open at
the corners, with a board laid on top to
keep the rain or snow from falling directly
into the hive. Nearly all of them
set on blocks from one to two inches
from the bottom board; they were ventilated
better than any bees I have seen
this season; he has 16 colonies to day,
alive, and apparently in good condition.
Perhaps there is more in ventilation
than chaff hives or cellars. Will some
one please rise and explain?</p>

<p id="Bees_Confined_5_Months"><b>Bees Confined 5 Months.</b>&mdash;Yesterday
my 115 colonies of bees had their first
flight since the last week in Oct., having
been confined to their hives 5
months, lacking 2 or 3 days only. This
is a month longer than I have ever had
them confined to the hive without a
flight, during the past 12 years, and to
my very great satisfaction as well as
astonishment, I do not find a single
dead colony. Some 5 or 10 are considerably
diseased, and a few are almost
sure to be found queenless. I expect to
lose from 5 to 15 between this and honey
harvest. Bees generally have wintered
very poorly in this section. From ½ to
2/3 of all the bees put in winter quarters
last fall, have died. I winter entirely
in chaff hives, and from what I hear I
judge that that method of wintering
has succeeded better than any other
during this past winter.</p>

<p id="Orchard_Apiary"><b>Orchard Apiary.</b>&mdash;The following is
my report for 1880; My bees came
through very strong in spring, and bred
rapidly, and were in excellent condition
to take advantage of fruit bloom, which
lasted about a week, during which time
they filled the hives well with honey,
and it is well that they did, for raspberry
and white clover proved a total
failure here, on account of bad weather
in June. My surplus all came from
basswood, which produced well for
about 10 days. Notwithstanding the
poor season, and it was the poorest we
we have had, I realized a profit of over
$8 per colony; but went into winter
quarters strong and with plenty of good
wholesome stores.</p>

<p id="Blasted_Hopes"><b>Blasted Hopes.</b>&mdash;For the first time, I
enroll myself in the army of “blasted
hopes.” My 150 colonies of bees are (all
but one) among the things that were. I
had no honey from them last season, or
at least none but what I fed back in the
fall, and a good many were entirely destitute,
so that I broke them up. Some
had a little honey and I gave that to
those that had a little more, and still
had 150 left. Winter set in early, about
the middle of Nov., before I had packed
any of them. I waited for milder
weather so that I could pack them, but
that did not come until the 6th of March.
Never a day did my bees have a fly until
then; and then I had but one colony
fly, and I hoped they would come
through all right in my double hives,
but they did not. Most of them had
plenty of honey. All of those having
honey had brood and some of them
young bees; such had soiled the combs.
The one that is alive is strong and has
plenty of brood. I thought that bees
did not commence to raise brood until
a warm spell, but it seems I was mistaken.
I have heretofore boxed up a
part and left a part unprotected, and
have had success with both. I think I
should have done better to have boxed
them up this year. I have now a lot of
empty hives and a great plenty of nice
combs. I shall not need any foundation
nor bee supplies this year; but
need bees to cover my combs. In the
<span class="smcap">Bee Journal</span> for March 9 Mr. Doolittle’s
article on “Bee Moths” contains
an error. A year or two ago I was at
a friend’s in Allegan Co., in this State,
in September, and he told me that the
moths were killing all of his bees. I
then thought like Mr. D., that they did
not hurt good colonies. He said they
did and showed me swarms, with new
white combs, the queen and brood all
right, but the sides of the hives were
white with moth cocoons. They were
all black bees; I do not think they
would have troubled Italians. I like
the <span class="smcap">Weekly Bee Journal</span> very much,
but do not know that it will be of much
value to me now. The cause of the
death of my bees was, I think, the long
steady cold, with no flight; and not the
extreme cold; but why did one of them
live through all right? It was just
like the rest in the fall.</p>

<p id="The_Outlook_Encouraging"><b>The Outlook Encouraging.</b>&mdash;The loss
in wintering has been very heavy in
this county during the past cold winter.
In one apiary near me, in Langstroth
hives, only 5 are now alive out of 100
last Oct. My home apiary of 175 colonies
last Oct., mostly in closed-end
Quinby-frame hives, wintered on summer
stands packed with fine straw and
chaff, now numbers only 115. The loss
has been much the heaviest in open end
frames, especially so in metal corner
frames. Out of 78 in such frame hives
only 2 colonies are left. Last year was
the poorest season I have had in 12
years; I had but one natural swarm
during the season. White clover was a
failure; there is but little basswood
near here. By feeding I kept my bees
in good condition for the fall harvest;
smart weed furnished a very little;
Spanish needle (the best honey plant in
this section) was a total failure; this is
the 2d year in 12 that it has failed. I
had one apiary near the Illinois river
which contained 120 colonies last spring,
in Quinby hives. The early part of the
season was poor, but I had during the
season 21 natural swarms and over 3000
lbs. of section honey for sale, with a
surplus of 3000 lbs. in brood frames;
more than enough to winter them,
which I brought to my home apiary.
The above harvest was wholly from
smart weed, which was grown on overflow
land near the Mississippi and Illinois
rivers. The loss in this apiary
will not exceed 10 from all causes. All
are strong and booming. The soft maples
are now in bloom; every fair day
the bees are carrying in pollen and a
very little honey; the elm will soon be
in bloom furnishing an abundance of
pollen for rapid queen rearing. With
favorable weather I expect a spring
harvest from the willow privet bush and
red haw; the honey from these is very
light colored and of excellent quality.
Your hopeful outlook for the coming
season is very cheering. The Weekly
is both a pleasure and a necessity with
me.</p>

chaff, on their summer stands; 3 in the
star chaff hive, 9 in the simplicity with
tight bottom and portico, and 2 in the

on 3 sides with snow; 12 faced south,
2 north, with no winter passages; used
the enameled cloth contrary to friend
Muth’s advice. I packed on each side
of those in single-wall hives with loose
chaff, also on the top. I had from 3 to 7
frames in each hive. All wintered
equally well, and to-day the queens are
doing their duty nobly, shut in on from
2 to 3 frames, and crowded with bees.
I think the chaff hive unnecessary for
this climate, but it is necessary to pack
them well with an absorbent in order
to bring them safely through our generally
changeable winters. Success to

from week to week, and its coming is

It must be hard to report a loss of ½ or
¾; and some of the reports even say&mdash;“all
dead.” I am afraid that some of
the bee-keepers in this section can say
ditto to these reports. The loss around
here is greater than there is any need
of, on account of the carelessness of
farmers in preparing their bees for winter;
some of them leave them out on
the summer stands without any protection
whatever, and of course the result
is plain. I have wintered mine in
the cellar for the past 2 seasons without
any loss, except one that starved this
winter; and I am to blame for that in
not knowing their condition when I
put them in the cellar. I think that
now all fear of loss is past, for my bees
are doing as well as could be desired.
They are breeding considerably, and
are all bright and healthy. The snow
is going off slowly, at last, and we may
look for spring soon. The maple trees
are full of swelling buds&mdash;it is too early
to say anything about fruit bloom; I
don’t know whether it is killed or not.

<p id="Losses_in_Wintering"><b>Losses in Wintering.</b>&mdash;Having seen
no report from this vicinity, I have
taken some pains to ascertain the extent
of the losses of the bee-men of
this part of Wayne county, Ind. I have
reports (some of them indirectly) from
34. Ten report a total loss; 8, 90 per
cent.; 6, 80 per cent.; the others from
33 to 25 per cent. The average loss of
colonies will probably be 80 per cent.,
and those colonies which survive are
very much reduced in numbers. Most
of them were left unprotected on the
summer stands. I find that those that
were taken into the cellar before the
severe cold of November, came through
with small loss, while those taken in
after ice had accumulated in the hive,
fared the worst of all. I am an advocate
of cellar wintering, having never
lost a colony until the present winter,
and that is through neglect in not taking
them in early; I lost 3 this time. I
am convinced that dysentery (the one
great cause of our loss) could have been
much mitigated by keeping an even
temperature, which cannot be done out-of-doors,
and had we removed their unsealed,
poor food and fed them candy
instead, our reports would have been
different. Two colonies thus treated
by me came through in good condition.
My bees gathered pollen and honey

<span class="large">BUYERS’ QUOTATIONS.</span></h2>

<h3>CHICAGO.</h3>

<p>HONEY&mdash;The market is plentifully supplied with
honey, and sales are slow at weak, easy prices. Quotable
at 18@20c. for strictly choice white comb in 1
and 2 lb. boxes; at 14@16c. for fair to good in large
packages, and at 10@12c. for common dark-colored
and broken lots. Extracted, 8@10c.</p>

<p>BEESWAX.&mdash;Choice yellow, 20@23c.; dark, 15@17.</p>

<h3>NEW YORK.</h3>

<p>HONEY.&mdash;Best white comb honey, small neat
packages, 14@16c.; fair do., 14@16c.; dark do., 11@12;
large boxes sell for about 2c. under above. White
extracted, 9@10c.; dark, 7@8c.; southern strained,
80@85c.</p>

<p>BEESWAX.&mdash;Prime quality, 20@23c.</p>

<h3>CINCINNATI.</h3>

<p>HONEY.&mdash;The market for extracted clover honey
is good, at 8@10c. Comb honey is of slow sale at 16c.
for the best.</p>

<p>BEESWAX.&mdash;18@22c.</p>

<h3>SAN FRANCISCO.</h3>

<p>HONEY.&mdash;The “Vigilant” takes 600 cases to Liverpool.
There is a slightly improved feeling consequent
upon a little more inquiry, but prices show no
material appreciation. Discouraging reports are received
from the southern part of the State, as to the
prospects of the coming crop, but other sections give
promise of an abundant yield. With a good supply
yet on the market, prices are not apt to be buoyant
until the anticipated failure is more fully settled.
We quote white comb, 12@13c.; dark to good, 9@11c.
Extracted, choice to extra white, 5½@6½c.; dark and
candied, 5@5½c.</p>

<p>BEESWAX.&mdash;22@22½c., as to color.</p>

<h2>WORTH WILL WIN.</h2>

<p>Truly, “Time sifts the wheat from the chaff.” We
lead in Smokers. Our Double-blast Smoker is
perfection. See what “the most extensive bee-keeper
in America” says of our Quinby Smoker:</p>

<p class="author">
Cherry Valley, N. Y., March 22, 1881.<br />
</p>

<p>After testing your smokers with others of the best
make, I do not hesitate to order two dozen for use in
our apiaries. When we use a Smoker we make a
business of it, running it all day and burning hard
maple wood, which tests the construction most thoroughly.
Those we have been using admit coals into
the bellows, which burn the leather. The tube in
your Quinby Smoker running further into the firebox,
must prevent this in a great measure.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
